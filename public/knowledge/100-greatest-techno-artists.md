## Methodology and scoring notes

This ranking prioritizes artists who embodied techno's core values: **innovation without compromise**, **community over commerce**, and **artistic integrity across decades**. The highest-ranked artists share common characteristics:

- **Label infrastructure builders**: Underground Resistance, Basic Channel, Tresor, Ilian Tape, Kompakt, Downwards, and Perc Trax founders created ecosystems sustaining entire scenes
- **Hardware purists**: TB-303, TR-808/909, and modular synthesizer dedication over software convenience
- **Scene service**: Mentorship, distribution networks (Submerge, 7th City, Hard Wax), and event curation
- **Anonymity as resistance**: Mad Mike Banks refusing photography, Drexciya's complete mystery, SNTS's masked identity
- **Geographic diversity**: Detroit originators, Berlin architects, Birmingham industrialists, Japanese psychedelic explorers, Bristol dubstep-techno pioneers

Artists received deductions for mainstream crossover success that compromised artistic vision, major label deals that didn't serve the underground, festival circuit dominance over club culture dedication, and trend-chasing that diluted their core sound.

The top 10 represent techno's philosophical and sonic foundation—artists who not only created the music but built the infrastructure, ideology, and community that allowed the genre to thrive for four decades outside commercial systems.
